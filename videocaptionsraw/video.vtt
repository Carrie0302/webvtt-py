TO UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING? 

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:43.269 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%

PROGRAMMING AT BOTH WEST LAKE 

00:14:04.276 --> 00:14:05.311 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
AND OCCIDENTAL AS WELL AS, WE 

00:14:05.311 --> 00:14:08.113 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%

THE CENTRAL AREA. 

00:14:13.219 --> 00:14:13.619 align:start size:23% position:13%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; OKAY. 

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:19.325 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%

THE PARK DISTRICT OPERATING 

00:14:33.739 --> 00:14:34.540 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%

EACH YEAR, AS YOU CAN SEE FROM 

00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:36.942 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THE CUMULATIVE ACTUALS TOTAL. 

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:38.410 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.645 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
2018. 

00:14:39.645 --> 00:14:42.248 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
SPENDING VARIES AMONG 

00:14:42.248 --> 00:14:43.048 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
INITIATIVES BASED ON WHAT THE 

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:48.520 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
INITIATIVE IS FUNDING. 

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:52.725 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
FOR EXAMPLE, INITIATIVE THREE-

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:07.439 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
HAPPENS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:08.073 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
WHEN THE COMMUNITY GROUPS 

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:08.707 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
RECEIVE THEIR REIMBURSABLE 

00:15:08.707 --> 00:15:09.074 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
BASED FUNDING. 

00:15:09.074 --> 00:15:09.942 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
OTHER FACTORS COULD INCLUDE 

00:15:09.942 --> 00:15:10.676 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
VACANCIES FOR POSITIONS FUNDED 

00:15:10.676 --> 00:15:14.380 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
THROUGH THE INITIATIVES AND 

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:21.887 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
ALSO WHEN THE TIMING OF BILLS 

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:22.154 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
OCCUR. 

00:15:22.154 --> 00:15:23.088 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
FOR EXAMPLE, IN INITIATIVE 1.6, 

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:24.089 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
UTILITY BUILDINGS, WE RECEIVE 

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:25.090 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
THOSE PILLS TWICE A YEAR. 

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.358 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
SO IT IS NOT A STRAIGHTFORWARD 

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:26.592 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
SPEND. 

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
AND WE FULLY EXPECT TO SPEND 

00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:28.794 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%

THANK YOU. 

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:44.837 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
THAT WAS MY MISTAKE. 

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:49.641 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
&gt;&gt; SO ON THE CAPITOL SIDE, THIS 

00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:50.843 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
TABLE SHOWS BUDGET TO ACTUALS 

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:51.944 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
2015 THROUGH 2018 AS WELL AS

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.081 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
AND CUMULATIVE SPENDING FOR THE 

00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:56.949 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
PARK DISTRICT ON THE CAPITOL 

00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:57.950 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
SIDE IS APPROXIMATELY 50%, AND 

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:01.587 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
THIS COMES FROM A TOTAL 

00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:07.292 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
ALLOCATION OF $142 MILLION, 

00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.494 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
WHICH IS COMPRISED OF THIS $140 

00:17:08.494 --> 00:17:09.561 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
MILLION IN THE 2015 THROUGH 

00:17:09.561 --> 00:17:12.364 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
2018 COLUMN AS WELL AS 28 

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:13.399 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
MILLION THAT WAS INCLUDED IN 

00:17:13.399 --> 00:17:23.909 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THE 2019 ADOPTED. I SHOULD NOTE 

00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:24.777 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
TOO THAT THE 2019 REVISED 

00:17:24.777 --> 00:17:25.778 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
BUDGET COLUMN YOU SEE HERE 

00:17:25.778 --> 00:17:26.779 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
INCLUDES BOTH CARRY FORWARD 

00:17:26.779 --> 00:17:27.813 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
FROM 2015 THROUGH 2018 AS WELL 

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:28.814 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
AS THE 2019 ADOPTED BUDGET. 

00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:30.015 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; CAN YOU SLOWDOWN? 

00:17:30.015 --> 00:17:31.884 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
SO WHAT WAS THE TOTAL AMOUNT 

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:32.484 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
LAST MONTH? 

00:17:32.484 --> 00:17:37.723 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
I LOST TWO. 

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.992 align:start size:23% position:13%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; OKAY. 

00:17:39.992 --> 00:17:41.427 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY HERE IS 

00:17:41.427 --> 00:17:42.227 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
THAT OUR TOTAL BUDGET 

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.228 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
ALLOCATION THUS FAR HAS BEEN 

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:44.430 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
ABOUT $142 MILLION, AND THAT IS 

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:50.936 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
COMPRISED OF $140 MILLION THAT 

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:52.604 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
WE HAD IN THE 2015 TO 2018 

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:52.838 align:start size:20% position:13%,middle line:74%
BUDGET. 

00:17:52.838 --> 00:17:54.206 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
AND THEN INCLUDED IN THE 2019 

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:57.943 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
REVISED BUDGET WE HAVE 28 

00:17:57.943 --> 00:17:59.912 align:start size:43% position:17%,middle line:74%
MILLION OF 2019. 

00:17:59.912 --> 00:18:01.146 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
SO THE 114 PLUS THE 28 MILLION 

00:18:01.146 --> 00:18:01.947 align:start size:50% position:20%,middle line:74%
EQUALS 142 MILLION. 

00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:06.218 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
TO DATE WE HAVE SPENT, AS YOU 

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:07.252 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
CAN SEE FROM THE ACTUALS 

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:09.455 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
COLUMNS, 49 MILLION FROM 2015 

00:18:09.455 --> 00:18:18.430 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
TO 2018 AS WELL AS 21 MILLION 

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.831 align:start size:25% position:13%,middle line:74%
FOR 2019. 

00:18:18.831 --> 00:18:20.032 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
SO THOSE TWO OUT UP TO 70 

00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:20.299 align:start size:23% position:13%,middle line:74%
MILLION. 

00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:21.667 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
IF YOU TAKE 70 MILLION INTO THE 

00:18:21.667 --> 00:18:23.869 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
142, YOU GET ABOUT 50%. 

00:18:23.869 --> 00:18:24.269 align:start size:23% position:13%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; OKAY. 

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:32.578 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; SO TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW ITEMS 

00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:33.178 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
IN THE SLIDE. 

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:34.847 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THE FIRST ONE I THINK IS ONE OF 

00:18:34.847 --> 00:18:35.681 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
INTEREST, THE ONE POINT ONE 

00:18:35.681 --> 00:18:41.286 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
MAJOR MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND 

00:18:41.286 --> 00:18:44.790 align:start size:45% position:18%,middle line:74%
ASSET MANAGEMENT. 

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:45.591 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
AND SPENDING HAS BEEN

THIS SINCE 2016 WITH A PLAN 

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:48.660 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
SPANNED THIS YEAR OF $22 

00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.497 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
MILLION, THE HIGHEST OF ALL THE 

00:18:51.497 --> 00:18:51.763 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
YEARS. 

00:18:51.763 --> 00:18:52.498 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
WE ARE ANTICIPATING THAT A 

00:18:52.498 --> 00:18:53.499 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
MAJORITY OF THE REMAINING MAJOR 

00:18:53.499 --> 00:18:54.399 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
MAINTENANCE INITIATIVE WILL BE

RENOVATIONS. 

00:19:13.185 --> 00:19:13.886 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
ANOTHER INITIATIVE TO HIGHLIGHT 

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:14.887 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
HERE IS ONE POINT TO, COMMUNITY 

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:16.922 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
CENTER REHABILITATION AND 

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:17.356 align:start size:33% position:15%,middle line:74%
DEVELOPMENT. 

00:19:17.356 --> 00:19:20.526 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
THIS IS THE ONE I THINK. 

00:19:20.526 --> 00:19:22.394 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
THIS WAS INITIALLY ON HOLD 

00:19:22.394 --> 00:19:32.804 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
WHILE WE COMPLETED THE 

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:35.607 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
COMMUNITY CENTER STRATEGIC 

00:19:35.607 --> 00:19:36.441 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
PLAN, WHICH WAS IN SEPTEMBER 

00:19:36.441 --> 00:19:36.642 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
2016. 

00:19:36.642 --> 00:19:37.442 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
STABILIZATION WORK IS UNDERWAY 

00:19:37.442 --> 00:19:38.644 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
FOR FIVEOF THE SIX CENTERS, 

00:19:38.644 --> 00:19:39.278 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
INCLUDING HIAWATHA, JEFFERSON, 

00:19:39.278 --> 00:19:40.245 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
MAGNOLIA, QUEEN AND AND SOUTH 

00:19:40.245 --> 00:19:40.646 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
PARK. 

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:42.114 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS A COMMUNITY CENTER 

00:19:42.114 --> 00:19:42.614 align:start size:43% position:17%,middle line:74%
ASSESSMENT PLAN? 

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:45.751 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; CORRECT. 

00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:46.218 align:start size:48% position:19%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; QUICK QUESTION. 

00:19:46.218 --> 00:19:52.558 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
I KNOW THAT ALL OF THESE 

00:19:52.558 --> 00:19:54.660 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
COMMUNITY CENTERS ARE CONCERNED 

00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:55.928 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
WE ARE PUTTING BAND-AIDS ON 

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:56.762 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS A 

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:57.362 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
MUCH BIGGER INVESTMENT. 

00:19:57.362 --> 00:19:58.764 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
WHERE ARE WE IN THAT SENSE OF 

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:05.470 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
MAKING THE MUCH BIGGER 

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:06.471 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
INVESTMENT FOR ALL OF THESE 

00:20:06.471 --> 00:20:06.905 align:start size:48% position:19%,middle line:74%
COMMUNITY CENTERS? 

00:20:06.905 --> 00:20:07.673 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT 

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:10.342 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
WE TALKED MANY TIMES ABOUT 

00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:11.343 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
BEING ABLE TO RESTORE THE 

00:20:11.343 --> 00:20:14.179 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
CENTER, BUT TO BUILD HOUSING ON 

00:20:14.179 --> 00:20:15.180 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
TOP OF SOME OF THEM. 

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.782 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. 

00:20:16.782 --> 00:20:18.050 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
SO THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION 

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:23.288 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
IN TERMS OF THE BAND-AID 

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:23.956 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
PRESSURE, YOU ARE EXACTLY 

00:20:23.956 --> 00:20:25.157 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
RIGHT, THAT WAS OUR CONCERN AS 

00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:25.457 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
WELL. 

00:20:25.457 --> 00:20:29.595 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
WE DID THE ORIGINAL PLAN, IT 

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:30.862 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
WAS LOOKING AT HOW TO INVEST 

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:36.501 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
ENOUGH SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO 

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:46.678 align:start size:23% position:13%,middle line:74%
OPERATE. 

00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:49.314 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
IT IS A LONGER-TERM QUESTION 

00:20:49.314 --> 00:20:50.315 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
PALMA BUT THAT WAS WHAT THE 

00:20:50.315 --> 00:20:51.383 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
STABILIZATION CONCEPT IS ABOUT. 

00:20:51.383 --> 00:20:52.084 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
IN TERMS OF LONGER-TERM 

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.385 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
INVESTMENT, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE 

00:20:53.385 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
IN THE MIDDLE OF RIGHT NOW. 

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:55.420 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THE STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS 

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.421 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
WE JUST FINISHED THAT WE WILL 

00:20:56.421 --> 00:20:57.823 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
COME BACK AND SHARE, AND THEN 

00:20:57.823 --> 00:20:58.523 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THAT STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS 

00:20:58.523 --> 00:20:59.891 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
WILL BE THE FOUNDATION FOR THE 

00:20:59.891 --> 00:21:01.126 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
CONVERSATION FOR THE NEXT 6 TO 

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:04.730 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
12 YEARS OF THE PARK DISTRICT 

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.997 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
CYCLE. 

00:21:04.997 --> 00:21:06.431 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
SO A BIG PART OF THAT WORK IS 

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:07.599 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
LOOKING AT ALL THE COMMUNITY 

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:08.834 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
CENTER PORTFOLIO TO GET A SENSE 

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:09.635 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
OF WHERE WE WANT THESE 

00:21:09.635 --> 00:21:11.036 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
COMMUNITY CENTERS TO BE FROM A 

00:21:11.036 --> 00:21:11.703 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
MINIMUM OPERATIONAL STANDPOINT 

00:21:11.703 --> 00:21:12.704 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
AND WHAT, IF ANYTHING, SHOULD 

00:21:12.704 --> 00:21:13.105 align:start size:33% position:15%,middle line:74%
BE EXPANDED. 

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:13.905 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
BEYOND THE BAND-AID BUT THOSE 

00:21:13.905 --> 00:21:15.140 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
ARE STILL THINGS WE ARE 

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:15.941 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
PLANNING IN THE FINANCIALS THAT 

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:17.342 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
WE DON'T HAVE, BUT I KNOW YOU 

00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:18.377 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
KNOW SOME OF THESE BUILDINGS, 

00:21:18.377 --> 00:21:19.611 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THAT NUMBER COULD GET VERY BIG 

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:20.212 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
VERY QUICKLY. 

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:21.413 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
SO WE HAVE TO BE VERY 

00:21:21.413 --> 00:21:22.047 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT HOW TO 

00:21:22.047 --> 00:21:23.048 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
STRATEGIZE WHERE THE CENTERS 

00:21:23.048 --> 00:21:23.215 align:start size:10% position:11%,middle line:74%
GO. 

00:21:23.215 --> 00:21:24.049 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 

00:21:24.049 --> 00:21:24.449 align:start size:23% position:13%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; OKAY. 

00:21:24.449 --> 00:21:25.450 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
ANOTHER WAY TO HIGHLIGHT IS 

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.554 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
INITIATIVE FOR.FOR, WHICH IS 

00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:31.757 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THE 14 NEW PARKS ATLANTA BANK 

00:21:31.757 --> 00:21:32.024 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
SITES. 

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:42.467 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
IN THIS CATEGORY, IN THIS 

00:21:43.235 --> 00:21:43.769 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
INITIATIVE SPENDING REFLECTS 

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:44.369 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
THE WERE CURRENTLY HAPPENING 

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:45.570 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
WITH THE 14 LAND BANK SITES. 

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.172 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THE CURRENT PLAN IS THAT 10 OF 

00:21:47.172 --> 00:21:48.440 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THE 14 WILL BE COMPLETE BY THE 

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.075 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
END OF 2020 AND FOUR WILL BE IN 

00:21:50.075 --> 00:21:50.409 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
CONSTRUCTION. 

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:51.276 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, 

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:51.877 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
THE FIRST COMPLETED PROJECT, 

00:21:51.877 --> 00:21:53.078 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
ALICE PAUL, OPENED IN JUNE OF 

00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:58.950 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
THIS YEAR AND URBAN TRIANGLE 

00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:59.785 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
WAS COMPLETED. 

00:21:59.785 --> 00:22:01.053 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
THE LAST ONE WE WANT TO 

00:22:01.053 --> 00:22:04.890 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU IS SMITH COVE 

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:05.290 align:start size:45% position:18%,middle line:74%
PARK DEVELOPMENT. 

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:06.291 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THIS ONE IS CURRENTLY IN EARLY 

00:22:06.291 --> 00:22:07.092 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
DESIGN STAGES, WHICH IS 

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:14.399 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
REFLECTED IN THE SPENDING, THE 

00:22:14.399 --> 00:22:14.800 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
LOW SPENDING. 

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.567 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTATION IS 

00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:16.668 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
NEAR 100%, AND THE TEAM IS 

00:22:16.668 --> 00:22:17.469 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
WAITING FOR FINAL PERMITS. 

00:22:17.469 --> 00:22:21.973 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THE PROJECT WILL BE BID IN THE 

00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:27.412 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
FALL OR WINTER, FALL OF 19 OR 

00:22:27.412 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
WINTER 2020 AND CONSTRUCTION 

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.681 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
WILL BEGIN IN EARLY 2020 IN THE 

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:30.282 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
SECOND PHASE, THE EASTERN 

00:22:30.282 --> 00:22:31.316 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
PORTION, WILL BE CONSIDERED AS 

00:22:31.316 --> 00:22:32.317 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
PART OF THE NEXT CYCLE 

00:22:32.317 --> 00:22:37.422 align:start size:40% position:17%,middle line:74%
FINANCIAL PLAN. 

00:22:37.422 --> 00:22:45.130 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; COUNCILMEMBER BACK SHOPPING 

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.431 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; I KNOW DON HARPER LIKE ME 

00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:47.532 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
HAS BEEN WORKING ON SMITH COVE 

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:48.734 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
PARK FOR WHAT IT FEELS LIKE 

00:22:48.734 --> 00:22:50.202 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
MUCH OF OUR LIFETIME NOW. 

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:51.403 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
BUT IT FEELS TO ME THAT THE 

00:22:51.403 --> 00:22:52.237 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
WHOLE PROJECT IS WAY MORE 

00:22:52.237 --> 00:22:53.238 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
EXPENSIVE THAN WHAT WE HAD 

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:53.772 align:start size:48% position:19%,middle line:74%
INITIALLY THOUGHT. 

00:22:53.772 --> 00:22:55.040 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
SO THE WEST SIDE WE HAD THE 

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.441 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
SOCCER FIELDS AND THEN WE HAD 

00:22:56.441 --> 00:23:02.147 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
TO DO THE CONSTRUCTION FOR THE 

00:23:02.147 --> 00:23:04.216 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
OVERFLOW, OR THE PIPES THAT 

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:05.217 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
WERE COMING DOWN OFF THE 

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:05.484 align:start size:25% position:13%,middle line:74%
HILLSIDE. 

00:23:05.484 --> 00:23:06.451 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
AND THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING 

00:23:06.451 --> 00:23:08.053 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
ELSE THAT WENT ON, AND THEN WE 

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:09.054 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
WERE DIGGING IT UP AGAIN. 

00:23:09.054 --> 00:23:10.255 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
DO WE HAVE A SCHEDULE NOW FOR 

00:23:10.255 --> 00:23:11.356 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
WHEN THAT WESTSIDE WILL BE 

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:11.723 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
COMPLETED? 

00:23:11.723 --> 00:23:12.758 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
AND ALSO, I KNOW THE 

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:13.425 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
NEIGHBORHOOD HAS REALLY BEEN 

00:23:13.425 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
INTERESTED IN THE EASTSIDE 

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:21.266 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
BECAUSE THAT TOUCHES WATER ON 

00:23:21.266 --> 00:23:22.267 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
THE EASTSIDE, BUT ALSO 

00:23:22.267 --> 00:23:23.268 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
POTENTIALLY RIGHT DOWN TO THE 

00:23:23.268 --> 00:23:24.736 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
WATER ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE 

00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:24.936 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
PARK. 

00:23:24.936 --> 00:23:26.571 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
WHAT IS THE SCHEDULE ABOUT? 

00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:27.973 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; THE WEST SIDE, WE EXPECT TO 

00:23:27.973 --> 00:23:33.779 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
GO TO CONSTRUCTION EARLY NEXT 

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:34.479 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
YEAR, 2020. 

00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:36.281 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
I DON'T HAVE A NOTE ON HOW LONG 

00:23:36.281 --> 00:23:37.082 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THE CONSTRUCTION IS ANTICIPATED 

00:23:37.082 --> 00:23:38.950 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
TO TAKE, BUT WE SHOULD START 

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:39.284 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
CONSTRUCTION. 

00:23:39.284 --> 00:23:40.352 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THE SECOND PHASE, AS YOU SAID, 

00:23:40.352 --> 00:23:46.191 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
IS PROBABLY JUST AS EXPENSIVE 

00:23:46.191 --> 00:23:48.894 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
AS THE FIRST PHASE, BUT THAT IS 

00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:50.395 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
NOT BEEN COSTED OUT YET AND THE 

00:23:50.395 --> 00:23:51.696 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
ANTICIPATION IS TO LOOK AT IT 

00:23:51.696 --> 00:23:52.364 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
FOR THE SECOND ROUND. 

00:23:52.364 --> 00:23:53.965 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE HAD MANY DESIGNS AND 

00:23:53.965 --> 00:23:55.000 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
PEOPLE IN MAGNOLIA AND QUEEN 

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.001 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
ANNE IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN 

00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:58.069 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
LOOKING AT MAKING THAT A PLACE 

00:23:58.069 --> 00:23:59.004 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
WHERE PEOPLE CAN LAUNCH THEIR 

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:04.009 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
KAYAKS AND ALSO DO, I THINK 

00:24:04.009 --> 00:24:12.451 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THERE WAS EVEN SOME VOLLEYBALL 

00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:13.685 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
COURTS THAT WERE GOING TO BE 

00:24:13.685 --> 00:24:14.085 align:start size:25% position:13%,middle line:74%
INCLUDED. 

00:24:14.085 --> 00:24:15.086 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
BUT PRIMARILY IT WAS NOT GOING 

00:24:15.086 --> 00:24:16.321 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
TO BE IS ACTIVELY SCHEDULED AS 

00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:17.522 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE WEST 

00:24:17.522 --> 00:24:17.923 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
SIDE. 

00:24:17.923 --> 00:24:20.792 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
I HEAR FROM COLLEAGUES, 

00:24:20.792 --> 00:24:21.793 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
PARTICULARLY MAGNOLIA, WE HAVE 

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:23.028 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
BEEN WORKING ON THIS THING FOR 

00:24:23.028 --> 00:24:24.229 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
15 YEARS, HOW COME IT IS NOT 

00:24:24.229 --> 00:24:24.629 align:start size:40% position:17%,middle line:74%
MOVING FORWARD? 

00:24:24.629 --> 00:24:26.031 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
SO I HOPE IN MY ABSENCE THAT 

00:24:26.031 --> 00:24:34.339 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE PEOPLE

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:36.007 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
THAT KEEP THAT ONE MOVING 

00:24:36.007 --> 00:24:36.274 align:start size:23% position:13%,middle line:74%
FORWARD. 

00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:36.641 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. 

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:37.843 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
I THINK IT DOES PRESENT A 

00:24:37.843 --> 00:24:38.443 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE 

00:24:38.443 --> 00:24:39.044 align:start size:50% position:20%,middle line:74%
WATER ACCESS AGAIN. 

00:24:39.044 --> 00:24:42.414 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
I THINK THAT IS THE EXCITING 

00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:43.748 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
PART OF IT. 

00:24:43.748 --> 00:24:45.350 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
BUT AS YOU SAID, IT IS NOT YET 

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:46.818 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
FUNDED, AND THERE IS A LOT OF 

00:24:46.818 --> 00:24:47.552 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
EXCITING CONCEPTUAL DESIGNS PUT 

00:24:47.552 --> 00:24:48.820 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
TOGETHER, BUT THE HOPE IS TO 

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:49.187 align:start size:25% position:13%,middle line:74%
CONTINUE. 

00:24:49.187 --> 00:24:50.856 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
&gt;&gt; WILL WE PUT MORE FUNDING IN, 

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:52.057 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
OR IS THAT THE PLAN FOR THE 

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:53.058 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
PARK DISTRICT GOING FORWARD SO 

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:53.859 align:start size:50% position:20%,middle line:74%
WE CAN COMPLETE IT? 

00:24:53.859 --> 00:24:55.527 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; IT IS ON OUR LIST OF THE 

00:24:55.527 --> 00:24:56.728 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THINGS THAT, OF THE VERY LONG 

00:24:56.728 --> 00:25:00.365 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
LIST OF THINGS IN TERMS OF 

00:25:00.365 --> 00:25:01.566 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
POTENTIALLY BEING FUNDED IN THE 

00:25:01.566 --> 00:25:02.834 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
SECOND OR THIRD ROUND OF THE 

00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:03.201 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
PARK DISTRICT. 

00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:06.471 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
IS DEFINITELY THERE. 

00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:06.872 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; SOMEWHERE. 

00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:10.942 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; JUST ON THE 2019 BUDGET 

00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:14.379 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
VERSUS ACTUALS, DID THE 

00:25:14.379 --> 00:25:15.380 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
TIMELINE SLIP FROM WHEN WE SET 

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:18.483 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
THE BUDGET LAST YEAR 

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:18.950 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
SIGNIFICANTLY? 

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:24.890 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; IN TERMS OF THE SPEND RATE? 

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:31.863 align:start size:23% position:13%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; YEAH. 

00:25:31.863 --> 00:25:32.497 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
SPENDING ALMOST 5.$5 MILLION 

00:25:32.497 --> 00:25:33.999 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
AND WE ARE AT $60 MILLION TO 

00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:34.299 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
DATE. 

00:25:34.299 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; I'M SORRY, YOU'RE TALKING 

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start size:45% position:18%,middle line:74%
ABOUT SMITH COVE. 

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.301 align:start size:43% position:17%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. 

00:25:36.301 --> 00:25:38.169 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE DESIGN AND THE 

00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:39.371 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
BIDDING AND ALL OF THAT TOOK A 

00:25:39.371 --> 00:25:40.238 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
LITTLE LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED. 

00:25:40.238 --> 00:25:42.407 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
THOSE COSTS ONLY REFLECT THE 

00:25:42.407 --> 00:25:42.807 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
EARLY DESIGN. 

00:25:42.807 --> 00:25:43.875 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
I'M SURE THEY'RE STILL BILLS 

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.510 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
DUE TO US FOR SOME OF THE FINAL 

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.912 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
DESIGN BEFORE WE GO TO BED. 

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:47.913 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; WHEN I LOOK ACROSS THE 

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:48.513 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
BOARD, ACTUALS THROUGH 

00:25:48.513 --> 00:25:51.383 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
SEPTEMBER VERSUS BUDGET. 

00:25:51.383 --> 00:25:56.221 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
WE'RE AT 22%, SO IS THAT THEME 

00:25:56.221 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
JUST CONSISTENT ACROSS THEM? 

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.728 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE DIFFERENT REASONS 

00:26:03.728 --> 00:26:04.796 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
FOR EACH OF THESE THINGS, BUT 

00:26:04.796 --> 00:26:09.034 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
HOLISTICALLY, IT IS BROUGHT 

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:09.901 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
THEMED THAT I AM REALLY 

00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:10.835 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
CONCERNED ABOUT LOOKING AT IT 

00:26:10.835 --> 00:26:11.903 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF JUST 

00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:12.904 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
BEING ABLE TO GET THE 

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:13.338 align:start size:33% position:15%,middle line:74%
INFORMATION. 

00:26:13.338 --> 00:26:23.815 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
FOR EXAMPLE, THIS TABLE IS 

00:26:24.783 --> 00:26:25.717 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
CONFUSING IN MANY WAYS. 

00:26:25.717 --> 00:26:26.751 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
NOT BECAUSE, ONLY BECAUSE IT IS 

00:26:26.751 --> 00:26:27.953 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
HARD TO PUT A LOT OF 

00:26:27.953 --> 00:26:28.286 align:start size:33% position:15%,middle line:74%
INFORMATION. 

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:29.354 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
FOR EXAMPLE, FOR 2019 THE $93 

00:26:29.354 --> 00:26:30.755 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
MILLION IN THE THIRD TO LAST 

00:26:30.755 --> 00:26:31.423 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
COLUMN INCLUDES CARRYOVER FUNDS 

00:26:31.423 --> 00:26:32.824 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
FROM 2015 THROUGH 2018 PLUS $28 

00:26:32.824 --> 00:26:33.425 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
MILLION NEW FOR 2019. 

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:37.662 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
THOSE CARRYOVERS ARE HARDER 

00:26:37.662 --> 00:26:38.463 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
BECAUSE THERE ARE PROJECTS IN 

00:26:38.463 --> 00:26:38.863 align:start size:40% position:17%,middle line:74%
VARIOUS STAGES. 

00:26:38.863 --> 00:26:39.731 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
SUMMER STILL STARTING EARLY, 

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:40.532 align:start size:45% position:18%,middle line:74%
SOME ALMOST DONE. 

00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:41.933 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
IT IS HARD TO TRACK THEM UNLESS 

00:26:41.933 --> 00:26:46.037 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
WE PUT TOGETHER A GIGANTIC 

00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:56.414 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
SPREADSHEET FOR YOU. 

00:27:02.754 --> 00:27:08.560 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
PLUS THE -- 

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.194 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; 70. 

00:27:09.194 --> 00:27:10.395 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; THE TOTAL WE SPENT IS ABOUT 

00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:16.301 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
50% OF EVERYTHING WE HAVE HAD 

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:26.511 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
ALLOCATED. 

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:27.412 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
AGAIN, EVERY PROJECT IS 

00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
DIFFERENT, SOME ARE COMPLETELY 

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.481 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
DONE IN SUMMER DELAYED FOR 

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:29.914 align:start size:48% position:19%,middle line:74%
DIFFERENT REASONS. 

00:27:29.914 --> 00:27:31.116 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THAT IS A NUMBER I AM WATCHING 

00:27:31.116 --> 00:27:32.517 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
VERY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE WE 

00:27:32.517 --> 00:27:33.718 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
CONTINUE TO STAY ON TOP OF IT 

00:27:33.718 --> 00:27:34.786 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
AND DO BETTER WITH REPORTING, 

00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:35.987 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
BUT ALSO DO BETTER WITH OUR 

00:27:35.987 --> 00:27:36.488 align:start size:50% position:20%,middle line:74%
PROJECT MANAGEMENT. 

00:27:36.488 --> 00:27:37.822 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
SO A COUPLE OF THINGS WE HAVE 

00:27:37.822 --> 00:27:39.224 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
DONE ALREADY IS WE HAVE MADE 

00:27:39.224 --> 00:27:40.025 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WITH OUR 

00:27:40.025 --> 00:27:40.558 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT 

00:27:40.558 --> 00:27:41.426 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
DIVISION THAT OVERSEES ALL 

00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:42.494 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
THESE PROJECTS TO JUST DO A 

00:27:42.494 --> 00:27:43.294 align:start size:50% position:20%,middle line:74%
BETTER JOB OF THAT. 

00:27:43.294 --> 00:27:44.729 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
WE ARE ADDING A NEW PROCESS FOR 

00:27:44.729 --> 00:27:45.930 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
EXAMPLE, A STAGE GATING PROCESS 

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:46.931 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THAT EACH STAGE WE HAVE BETTER 

00:27:46.931 --> 00:27:47.799 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
INFORMATION BECAUSE OFTEN WHAT 

00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:48.800 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
WILL HAPPEN, BUT THE PROJECT 

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:50.201 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
WILL GO THROUGH, AND WHEN IT IS 

00:27:50.201 --> 00:27:58.543 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
ABOUT TO GO TO BED, WE REALIZE 

00:27:58.543 --> 00:27:59.744 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THE ESTIMATES ARE HIGHER THAN 

00:27:59.744 --> 00:28:00.945 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THE BUDGET SO THEN THE KIDS PUT 

00:28:00.945 --> 00:28:02.347 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
ON HOLD AND THEN WE HAVE TO 

00:28:02.347 --> 00:28:03.615 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
FIGURE OUT HOW TO FUND IT. 

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:05.250 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
WE WANT TO SET IT UP SO THAT 

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:06.418 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
EACH STAGE WE HAVE THOSE 

00:28:06.418 --> 00:28:07.252 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
CONVERSATIONS EARLY AND HAVE A 

00:28:07.252 --> 00:28:08.453 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
BETTER SENSE OF WHAT IS 

00:28:08.453 --> 00:28:08.787 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
HAPPENING. 

00:28:08.787 --> 00:28:09.654 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
AND FRANKLY WE JUST ADDED MORE 

00:28:09.654 --> 00:28:09.954 align:start size:25% position:13%,middle line:74%
CAPACITY. 

00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:11.322 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THIS IS A GROUP THAT HAS BEEN 

00:28:11.322 --> 00:28:12.157 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
DELIVERING ROUGHLY $70 MILLION 

00:28:12.157 --> 00:28:13.358 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
WORTH OF PROJECTS EVERY YEAR. 

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:14.359 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
AT LEAST ACTIVE PROJECTS. 

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:15.560 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS WE 

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.228 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
HAVE ADDED MORE STAFF THERE. 

00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:26.371 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
FINALLY, WE ARE GETTING AN 

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:27.172 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
OUTSIDE CONSULTANT, PAR 

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:27.972 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
CONSULTING, COMING IN AND 

00:28:27.972 --> 00:28:29.174 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
DIGGING INTO ALL OF THESE AND 

00:28:29.174 --> 00:28:30.175 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
GIVING RECOMMENDATIONS, SOME OF 

00:28:30.175 --> 00:28:31.242 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
WHICH WERE ALREADY STARTING TO 

00:28:31.242 --> 00:28:31.543 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
IMPLEMENT. 

00:28:31.543 --> 00:28:34.879 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
BUT OUR HOPE IS THAT AS WE 

00:28:34.879 --> 00:28:36.281 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
CLOSE OUT THIS FIRST SIX YEAR 

00:28:36.281 --> 00:28:37.482 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
CYCLE, WE ARE DOING BETTER NOW 

00:28:37.482 --> 00:28:38.550 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
WAS SPENDING, BUT REALLY HAVE A 

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:43.788 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
SOLID PLAN TO MAKE SURE WE ARE 

00:28:43.788 --> 00:28:44.456 align:start size:50% position:20%,middle line:74%
BETTER AT MANAGING. 

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:45.256 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
AND PRESENTING THE INFORMATION 

00:28:45.256 --> 00:28:46.691 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
IN A WAY THAT IS EASIER TO 

00:28:46.691 --> 00:28:49.094 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
FOLLOW FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND. 

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:50.495 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; I WILL JUST SAY THAT IT 

00:28:50.495 --> 00:28:51.563 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
SEEMS LIKE A SIMILAR PARALLEL 

00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:54.399 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES 

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:57.602 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
D.O.T. 

00:28:57.602 --> 00:29:00.705 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
HAS HAD. ITSELF LIKE SOME OF 

00:29:00.705 --> 00:29:01.706 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THE RESPONSES YOU'RE MAKING ARE 

00:29:01.706 --> 00:29:02.907 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
SIMILAR TO THAT, WHICH IS 

00:29:02.907 --> 00:29:03.141 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
GREAT. 

00:29:03.141 --> 00:29:05.577 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
OBVIOUSLY, AS WE MOVE TOWARDS 

00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:06.778 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
THIS TIME NEXT YEAR WHEN WE 

00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:08.413 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
WILL BE UPDATING, I THINK IT IS 

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:09.614 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
GOING TO BE REALLY HELPFUL TO 

00:29:09.614 --> 00:29:10.415 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
HAVE AS MUCH CLARITY ABOUT 

00:29:10.415 --> 00:29:12.217 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
WHERE WE ARE GOING ON THAT. 

00:29:12.217 --> 00:29:17.322 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
YOU KNOW, WHEN A PROJECT TAKES 

00:29:17.322 --> 00:29:18.189 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
FOUR YEARS INSTEAD OF TWO 

00:29:18.189 --> 00:29:23.995 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
YEARS, THERE IS PROBABLY AT A 

00:29:23.995 --> 00:29:29.534 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
COST, BUT THE BIGGEST THING FOR 

00:29:29.534 --> 00:29:30.535 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
MY PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THE 

00:29:30.535 --> 00:29:31.736 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
PROJECT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO BE 

00:29:31.736 --> 00:29:33.004 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
USED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. 

00:29:33.004 --> 00:29:34.439 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
IF THE REALITY IS THAT WE ARE 

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:35.607 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
JUST TOO AMBITIOUS IN THE 

00:29:35.607 --> 00:29:36.441 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
TIMELINES AND THE PROJECTS ARE 

00:29:36.441 --> 00:29:37.642 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
FOR YOUR PROJECTS, AND WE JUST 

00:29:37.642 --> 00:29:39.043 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
MISSED THAT WHEN WE FIRST PUT 

00:29:39.043 --> 00:29:40.044 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
IT IN, THEN THAT IS FAIR. 

00:29:40.044 --> 00:29:41.312 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
LET'S USE THAT WHEN WE THINK 

00:29:41.312 --> 00:29:47.352 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
ABOUT HOW MUCH CAPACITY WE HAVE 

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:57.862 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
NEXT YEAR WITH THE CASH FLOWS 

00:29:58.096 --> 00:29:59.364 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
COMING IN, AND LET'S MATCH THE 

00:29:59.364 --> 00:30:00.965 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
STAFF TO THAT AS SOON AS WE CAN 

00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:01.199 align:start size:13% position:11%,middle line:74%
TOO. 

00:30:01.199 --> 00:30:01.566 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. 

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:02.634 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
BECAUSE NOT EVERY PROJECT TAKES 

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:03.468 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME. 

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:04.669 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE 

00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:05.503 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
SPECIFIC ABOUT THESE INDIVIDUAL 

00:30:05.503 --> 00:30:05.770 align:start size:23% position:13%,middle line:74%
POJECTS. 

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:06.871 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
WHICH WILL HAVE INPUT IN THE 

00:30:06.871 --> 00:30:07.672 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
WAY WE BUDGET. 

00:30:07.672 --> 00:30:08.740 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE WAY WE 

00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:09.774 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
BUDGET, WE BUDGET FOR EVERY 

00:30:09.774 --> 00:30:10.775 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
PROJECT HAVING THESE THREE 

00:30:10.775 --> 00:30:11.976 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
PHASES IS A PHASE 1 IS THIS 

00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:13.378 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
YOUR, PHASE 2 IS THIS YEAR, BUT 

00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:14.445 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
IF ANYTHING CHANGES BECAUSE THE 

00:30:14.445 --> 00:30:15.446 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
SCOPE IS DIFFERENT, THEN THE 

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:16.447 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
BUDGETING IS OUT OF WHACK. 

00:30:16.447 --> 00:30:18.082 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
SO WE WANT TO GET BETTER AT 

00:30:18.082 --> 00:30:18.883 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
EACH YEAR UPDATING THE BUDGET 

00:30:18.883 --> 00:30:20.285 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
TO GET A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT 

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:20.885 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
IS HAPPENING. 

00:30:20.885 --> 00:30:22.353 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
&gt;&gt; I THINK WE NEED TO SELL THEM 

00:30:22.353 --> 00:30:23.555 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
AS THE PARKS DISTRICT, BUT THE 

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:30.395 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
REPORTING, I KNOW D.O.T. 

00:30:30.395 --> 00:30:31.296 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
HAS STRUGGLED WITH HOW TO 

00:30:31.296 --> 00:30:32.096 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
ACCURATELY REPORT THE CARRYOVER 

00:30:32.096 --> 00:30:33.298 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
MONEY FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS 

00:30:33.298 --> 00:30:33.531 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
YEAR. 

00:30:33.531 --> 00:30:34.899 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
ARE WE ON TARGET OR NOT? 

00:30:34.899 --> 00:30:38.203 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT THE 

00:30:38.203 --> 00:30:38.536 align:start size:20% position:13%,middle line:74%
NUMBER. 

00:30:38.536 --> 00:30:39.804 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
SO NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 

00:30:39.804 --> 00:30:41.005 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
TO WORK ON, BUT SOME WAY TO 

00:30:41.005 --> 00:30:42.473 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
REPORT ON THAT SO WE CAN HAVE 

00:30:42.473 --> 00:30:48.279 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
WAYS TO ESSENTIALLY HOLD YOU 

00:30:48.279 --> 00:30:51.583 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
ALL ACCOUNTABLE TO SAY I KNOW 

00:30:51.583 --> 00:30:53.017 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
WE STARTED OFF SLOW, BUT ARE WE 

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:53.818 align:start size:33% position:15%,middle line:74%
ON PACE NOW? 

00:30:53.818 --> 00:30:54.619 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
SOME WAY TO DELIVER THAT 

00:30:54.619 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
INFORMATION WOULD BE HELPFUL. 

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:56.688 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; NOT KEEPING THIS TO DEATH, 

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:57.488 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
THE OTHER COMPETITION IN 

00:30:57.488 --> 00:30:58.690 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
ADDITION TO TIMING IS THE 

00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:59.257 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES. 

00:30:59.257 --> 00:31:00.325 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THAT IS WHERE THE TRANSPARENCY 

00:31:00.325 --> 00:31:01.326 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
PIECE GETS REALLY IMPORTANT AND 

00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:01.659 align:start size:33% position:15%,middle line:74%
COMPLICATED. 

00:31:01.659 --> 00:31:07.532 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
I DO YOU THINK IT IS REALLY 

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:07.865 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
IMPORTANT. 

00:31:07.865 --> 00:31:09.834 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; WILL BE GO INTO THE NEXT 

00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:11.102 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
PLAN, WE MAY WANT TO THINK 

00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:11.903 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
ABOUT BUDGETING BECAUSE REALLY 

00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:13.137 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
WHAT WE HAVE ON THE CAPITOL 

00:31:13.137 --> 00:31:14.005 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
SIDE IS THE APPROPRIATION. 

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:15.340 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
IS NOT THE SPENDING PLAN, AND 

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.241 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
JUST EXACTLY WHAT JESUS IS 

00:31:16.241 --> 00:31:22.046 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
SAYING, SOME ARE MULTIPLE YEARS

00:31:22.046 --> 00:31:23.248 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
. THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY 

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:24.449 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
SPEND A LOT OF THEIR BUDGET 

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:25.717 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
UNTIL THEY GET TO CONSTRUCTION. 

00:31:25.717 --> 00:31:27.151 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT YOU SEE IN 

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:27.952 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
FRONT OF YOU. 

00:31:27.952 --> 00:31:28.620 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
YOU SEE THE APPROPRIATION. 

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:34.659 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THAT IS MUCH MORE TRUE FOR THE 

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:35.860 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
OPERATING WHERE YOU GET THE 

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.061 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
APPROPRIATION IN THAT ONE YEAR 

00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:38.329 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
AND SPEND ALMOST 99% OF THE 

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:39.564 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
MONEY GETS SPENT IN THAT ONE 

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:39.764 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
YEAR. 

00:31:39.764 --> 00:31:40.765 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, THAT IS THE REALITY, 

00:31:40.765 --> 00:31:41.766 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
THEN OBVIOUSLY ALL THE 

00:31:41.766 --> 00:31:42.233 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
QUESTIONS ARE MOVED. 

00:31:42.233 --> 00:31:43.768 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
SEEMS LIKE THERE IS A MIX OF 

00:31:43.768 --> 00:31:44.035 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
THING. 

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:49.874 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT IS ALL WE HAD. 

00:31:49.874 --> 00:31:50.441 align:start size:45% position:18%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; ANYTHING ELSE? 

00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:50.875 align:start size:43% position:17%,middle line:74%
WORDS OF WISDOM? 

00:31:50.875 --> 00:31:51.276 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; NO. 

00:31:51.276 --> 00:31:51.743 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
THANK YOU. 

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:56.381 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER. 

00:31:56.381 --> 00:31:56.981 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 

00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:58.182 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; CHAIR, I HAVE A QUESTION. 

00:31:58.182 --> 00:32:03.087 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
WE HAD A PUBLIC HEARING ON 

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:03.888 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
THREE RESOLUTIONS RELATED TO 

00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:04.889 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
THE REVENUE SOURCES FOR THE 

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:06.391 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
2020 OPERATIONS BUDGET AND THE 

00:32:06.391 --> 00:32:12.397 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
POTENTIAL TAX LEVY INCREASE IN 

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:12.730 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
2020. 

00:32:12.730 --> 00:32:13.865 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
ARE WE, ARE THESE PART OF 

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:14.666 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
BUDGET LEGISLATION WE'RE GOING 

00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:21.806 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
TO VOTE ON? 

00:32:21.806 --> 00:32:23.007 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; WE WERE ACTUALLY VOTED THEM 

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:24.409 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
NEXT ON MONDAY AFTER THE VOTE 

00:32:24.409 --> 00:32:25.610 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
ON THE ENTIRE BUDGET, THEN WE 

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.477 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
GO INTO THE PARK DISTRICT 

00:32:26.477 --> 00:32:27.478 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
MEETING AND ADOPT ALL THE 

00:32:27.478 --> 00:32:28.479 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
RESOLUTIONS AND THEN ADOPT A 

00:32:28.479 --> 00:32:29.280 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
PARKS DISTRICT PORTION OF 

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:29.914 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
FUNDING AND BUDGETS. 

00:32:29.914 --> 00:32:32.150 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
&gt;&gt; AND SO, I AM JUST STRUGGLING 

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.787 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
A LITTLE BIT WITH THE FACT THAT 

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:37.622 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
IT APPEARS WE'RE MAKING SOME 

00:32:37.622 --> 00:32:42.694 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
COMMITMENTS FOR 2020, BOTH ON 

00:32:42.694 --> 00:32:47.332 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THE OPERATING AND CAPITOL SIDE. 

00:32:47.332 --> 00:32:48.800 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
AND WE DID NOT HEAR VERY MUCH 

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:58.042 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
FROM THE PUBLIC TODAY ON THAT. 

00:32:58.042 --> 00:32:59.344 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
COULD YOU MAYBE TALK A LITTLE 

00:32:59.344 --> 00:33:00.144 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
BIT MORE ABOUT THE PUBLIC 

00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:01.212 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
PROCESS THAT PARKS HAS DONE 

00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:02.213 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
THAT IS LED TO THESE 

00:33:02.213 --> 00:33:03.014 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
RECOMMENDATIONS AND THESE THREE 

00:33:03.014 --> 00:33:03.348 align:start size:33% position:15%,middle line:74%
RESOLUTIONS? 

00:33:03.348 --> 00:33:04.649 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; WE HAVE NOT HAD A PUBLIC 

00:33:04.649 --> 00:33:05.049 align:start size:33% position:15%,middle line:74%
HEARING YET. 

00:33:05.049 --> 00:33:06.250 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
I THINK THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE 

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.852 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
SIGNED UP. 

00:33:07.852 --> 00:33:08.252 align:start size:25% position:13%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; SORRY. 

00:33:08.252 --> 00:33:13.758 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%

I'M JUST WONDERING. 

00:33:16.627 --> 00:33:21.065 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%

PART OF THE BROADER? GOT IT. 

00:33:37.615 --> 00:33:38.583 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%

ENGAGEMENT, SO CERTAINLY 

00:33:39.183 --> 00:33:39.984 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
THERE'LL BE THIS HEARING. 

00:33:39.984 --> 00:33:41.185 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:54.418 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED. 

00:35:54.418 --> 00:36:00.725 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
THE FIRST ONE IS TO RESTORE 

00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:01.926 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
COMMUNITY CENTER OPS AS ALL THE 

00:36:01.926 --> 00:36:02.593 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
$1.4 MILLION THAT WAS 

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:03.594 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
ORIGINALLY CUT FROM THIS LINE 

00:36:03.594 --> 00:36:06.030 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
ITEM THEN RESTORED SINCE YOUR 

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:11.435 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
2018 BUDGET ACTION ONLY 

00:36:11.435 --> 00:36:19.243 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
RESTORED $850,000 OF THOSE 

00:36:19.243 --> 00:36:19.644 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
FUNDS. 

00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:20.444 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
SO THAT IS THE QUESTION. 

00:36:20.444 --> 00:36:21.846 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
TWO I AM AWARE THAT THE 

00:36:21.846 --> 00:36:22.513 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
COMMUNITY LINE ITEM WAS 

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:23.147 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY IN 

00:36:23.147 --> 00:36:23.347 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
2019. 

00:36:23.347 --> 00:36:24.715 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
IT WAS AT ONE POINT I MILLION 

00:36:24.715 --> 00:36:25.917 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
DOLLARS INCREASE TO FUND THE 

00:36:25.917 --> 00:36:26.751 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
COMMUNITY CENTER POSITIONS AT 

00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:27.752 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
TRENT ARC WAS NO LONGER WILLING 

00:36:27.752 --> 00:36:30.821 align:start size:23% position:13%,middle line:74%
TO FUND. 

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:31.455 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
SECOND AREA, COMMUNITY CENTER 

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.056 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
WE HAVE DEVELOPMENT. 

00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:33.057 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION 

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:34.058 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
IN LIGHT ITEMS STARTING IN 2019 

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:37.728 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
AND 2020 OF $320,000, HOW MUCH 

00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:41.766 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
OF THAT BUDGET WAS ACTUALLY 

00:36:41.766 --> 00:36:42.033 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
SPENT? 

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:43.167 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
I THINK THE ANSWER TO THAT 

00:36:43.167 --> 00:36:45.636 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
QUESTION WAS $2.5 MILLION. 

00:36:45.636 --> 00:36:50.441 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
DID ANY OF THE SIX IDENTIFIED 

00:36:50.441 --> 00:36:59.884 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
COMMUNITY CENTERS GET PLAITED? 

00:36:59.884 --> 00:37:01.485 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
I DID NOT HEAR THE ANY OF THEM 

00:37:01.485 --> 00:37:01.686 align:start size:13% position:11%,middle line:74%
DID. 

00:37:01.686 --> 00:37:02.887 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
IT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE STILL 

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:03.554 align:start size:43% position:17%,middle line:74%
ALL IN PROGRESS. 

00:37:03.554 --> 00:37:04.855 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
AND WHAT KIND OF FINANCIAL 

00:37:04.855 --> 00:37:05.556 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
OBLIGATION AGAINST THE NEXT SIX 

00:37:05.556 --> 00:37:06.591 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
YEAR FUNDING CYCLE WILL BE 

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:07.558 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
CREATED TO FINISH THOSE SIX 

00:37:07.558 --> 00:37:12.697 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
COMMUNITY CENTERS THAT WERE NOT 

00:37:12.697 --> 00:37:12.997 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
COMPLETED? 

00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:14.065 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
I WOULD LIKE TO REITERATE A 

00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:15.099 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
RECOMMENDATION I MADE YOU IN 

00:37:15.099 --> 00:37:16.300 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND 

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:17.301 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
THAT IS TO REVISE THE PARK 

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:18.102 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
DISTRICT RESOLUTION TO ALLOW 

00:37:18.102 --> 00:37:18.970 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
FOR MIDYEAR CORRECTIONS THAT 

00:37:18.970 --> 00:37:19.971 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
WOULD ALLOW FOR INCREASES AND 

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:20.771 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
SPENDING PLAN IF NEEDED. 

00:37:20.771 --> 00:37:21.806 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THIS POSSIBILITY IS NEEDED TO 

00:37:21.806 --> 00:37:23.007 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
ALLOW CHANGES TO THE SPENDING 

00:37:23.007 --> 00:37:24.008 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
PLAN TO REFLECT MAJOR CHANGES 

00:37:24.008 --> 00:37:25.009 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
THAT OCCUR THAT ARE NOT 

00:37:25.009 --> 00:37:25.376 align:start size:33% position:15%,middle line:74%
ANTICIPATED. 

00:37:25.376 --> 00:37:26.677 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
IN THE LAST SIX YEARS WE HAVE 

00:37:26.677 --> 00:37:27.278 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
SEEN SOME HUGE CHANGES, 

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:28.512 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
ESPECIALLY IN THE GROWTH OF THE 

00:37:28.512 --> 00:37:28.713 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
CITY. 

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:30.114 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
SO I WANT TO THANK THE CITY 

00:37:30.114 --> 00:37:31.115 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%

&gt;&gt; MY NAME IS PAT GRIFFITH. 

00:38:01.412 --> 00:38:02.446 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
MY ORIGINAL COMMENTS AND THE 

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:05.249 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
REASON I CAME WERE MADE BY MR.

AND MR. HARPER. 

00:38:07.118 --> 00:38:11.355 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%

00:38:11.355 --> 00:38:15.026 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
RECEIVED ANY INFORMATION ON A 

00:38:15.026 --> 00:38:15.626 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%

00:38:17.461 --> 00:38:26.103 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THAT DOES NOT SEEM QUITE KOSHER.

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:27.638 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
AND I AM WONDERING WHY AN 

00:38:27.638 --> 00:38:28.572 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
INCREASE IS NECESSARY IF WE 

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
HAVE SUCH AN UNDER SPEND? 

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.745 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%

LIFETIME ON SMITH COVE. 

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:58.502 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
YOU HAVE BEEN THERE TOO. 

00:38:58.502 --> 00:39:00.104 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
AND WE REALLY LIKE TO SEE IT 

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:00.304 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
DONE. 

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:05.376 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
IT IS BEEN PUT OFF AND PUT OFF 

00:39:05.376 --> 00:39:06.210 align:start size:50% position:20%,middle line:74%
AND PEOPLE ARE VERY 

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:06.544 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
DISAPPOINTED. 

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:07.211 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT YOU 

00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:12.817 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
CHANGED THE WHOLE COMMUNITY 

00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
DEVELOPMENT PLAN BECAUSE YOU 

00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:15.686 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
HAVE THIS HIGH-POWERED 

00:39:15.686 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
INTERNATIONAL COMPANY, G GN, 

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:17.588 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
THAT HAVE NEVER DONE PUBLIC 

00:39:17.588 --> 00:39:18.789 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
MEETINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT. 

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:19.790 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
I ALSO WANT TO ECHO. 

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:24.628 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
I AM WITH GREEN SEATTLE 

00:39:24.628 --> 00:39:25.696 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
PARTNERSHIP TOO, I WAS ONE OF 

00:39:25.696 --> 00:39:26.530 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
THE ORIGINAL FOUR STEWARDS. 

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.732 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
I JUST RECENTLY FOUND OUT THAT 

00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:28.532 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
GREEN SEATTLE PARTNERSHIP 

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:30.134 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
BUDGET WAS CUT IN THIS LAST 

00:39:30.134 --> 00:39:30.367 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
YEAR. 

00:39:30.367 --> 00:39:33.404 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
THAT WAS KEPT PRETTY QUIET. 

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:35.840 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
WE DO A LOT OF WORK. 

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
WITHOUT ALL THE VOLUNTEER 

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:47.184 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
HOURS, YOUR PARKS, YOUR FOREST 

00:39:47.485 --> 00:39:48.652 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
AND PARKS, WOULD BE IN REALLY 

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:48.953 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
BAD SHAPE. 

00:39:48.953 --> 00:39:50.421 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THIRD THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY 

00:39:50.421 --> 00:39:51.255 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
IS ECHO WITH PAT SAID. 

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:52.456 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
THE REASON WE DON'T HAVE 

00:39:52.456 --> 00:39:53.524 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
ANYBODY HERE IS BECAUSE NOBODY 

00:39:53.524 --> 00:39:53.958 align:start size:40% position:17%,middle line:74%
KNOWS ABOUT IT. 

00:39:53.958 --> 00:39:55.359 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
I MEAN, YOU GET THE NOTICE, BUT 

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.360 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
THERE WERE NO ATTACHING 

00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:00.231 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
DOCUMENTS TO THIS AGENDA. 

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:01.665 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THERE WAS FINALLY A LINK PUT ON 

00:40:01.665 --> 00:40:02.867 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
THE PARK DISTRICT PAGE, AND 

00:40:02.867 --> 00:40:04.068 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THEN YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH FIVE 

00:40:04.068 --> 00:40:06.737 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
OR SIX PAGES TO FIND SOME 

00:40:06.737 --> 00:40:07.204 align:start size:40% position:17%,middle line:74%
ACTUAL NUMBERS. 

00:40:07.204 --> 00:40:08.572 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
WHY COULDN'T YOU PUT A LINK ON 

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:09.573 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THE AGENDA, WHICH IS TYPICAL? 

00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:15.279 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A COUNCIL A 

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
GENTLE AGENDA WITHOUT A LINK TO 

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:17.148 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS. 

00:40:17.148 --> 00:40:18.082 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING, WHAT IS 

00:40:18.082 --> 00:40:18.416 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
HAPPENING? 

00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:19.483 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
IT IS LIKE, I DON'T KNOW. 

00:40:19.483 --> 00:40:20.151 align:start size:40% position:17%,middle line:74%
IT DOESN'T SAY. 

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:21.385 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THEY'RE GOING TO VOTE NEXT WEEK 

00:40:21.385 --> 00:40:22.787 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
ON A BUDGET, BUT THEY WILL NOT 

00:40:22.787 --> 00:40:29.693 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
TELL US WHAT THE BUDGET IS. 

00:40:29.693 --> 00:40:31.095 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
SO YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT 

00:40:31.095 --> 00:40:32.496 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
IF YOU WANT TO INCLUDE THE 

00:40:32.496 --> 00:40:32.763 align:start size:20% position:13%,middle line:74%
PUBLIC. 

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:34.064 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THE TAX 

00:40:34.064 --> 00:40:35.166 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
INCREASE WITHOUT A VOTE, BUT 

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:37.601 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
PEOPLE AT LEAST NEED TO KNOW. 

00:40:37.601 --> 00:40:39.003 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
TIM SAYING THE $.21 IS THE 

00:40:39.003 --> 00:40:40.070 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
FIRST TIME I HAVE HEARD. 

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:41.272 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
I KNOW HE FOLLOWS IT MORE THAN 

00:40:41.272 --> 00:40:42.873 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
I DO, BUT I FOLLOW A LOT OF 

00:40:42.873 --> 00:40:43.507 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
YOUR STUFF. 

00:40:43.507 --> 00:40:44.308 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
SO THINK ABOUT THAT. 

00:40:44.308 --> 00:40:48.179 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
IF YOU WANT THE COMMUNITY, WE 

00:40:48.179 --> 00:40:49.613 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
DON'T ALL HAVE TIME TO GO TO 

00:40:49.613 --> 00:40:50.614 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE OR THE 

00:40:50.614 --> 00:40:51.415 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
PARKS COMMISSIONERS AND THAT 

00:40:51.415 --> 00:40:53.818 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
KIND OF THING. 

00:40:53.818 --> 00:40:54.885 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; LET ME CLEAR SOMETHING UP. 

00:40:54.885 --> 00:40:56.120 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
WE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF 

00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.324 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
CONFUSION ABOUT WHEN WE POSTED 

00:41:00.324 --> 00:41:00.658 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
THE NOTICE. 

00:41:00.658 --> 00:41:01.325 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; THE ATTACHMENTS AND 

00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:02.026 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS, MY 

00:41:02.026 --> 00:41:03.027 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THEY WERE 

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:03.427 align:start size:25% position:13%,middle line:74%
ALL HERE. 

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:10.701 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
AND THE TAXES. 

00:41:10.701 --> 00:41:12.136 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; NOT ON MY PHONE WITH MY 

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:12.369 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
EMAIL. 

00:41:12.369 --> 00:41:14.138 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO GET IN AN 

00:41:14.138 --> 00:41:14.438 align:start size:25% position:13%,middle line:74%
ARGUMENT. 

00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:15.406 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
I WILL MEET WITH YOU AFTERWARDS

FRIDAY. 

00:41:17.842 --> 00:41:18.843 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
I THINK WE GOT ALL THE 

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:24.515 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
MATERIALS TO THE CLERKS BY 

00:41:24.515 --> 00:41:28.752 align:start size:20% position:13%,middle line:74%
FRIDAY. 

00:41:28.752 --> 00:41:30.421 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
SO THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND 

00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:31.455 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
THEM BY GOING TO THE COUNCIL 

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:32.456 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
WEBPAGE THAT TAKES INTO THE 

00:41:32.456 --> 00:41:33.657 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
PARK DISTRICT BECAUSE WE TRIED 

00:41:33.657 --> 00:41:34.458 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
TO DO A COMBINED WEBSITE. 

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:35.659 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
THEY SHOULD'VE HAD ALL THE 

00:41:35.659 --> 00:41:36.527 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%

WHO IS NEXT? 

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:51.342 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; SUSAN KATHY -- CASEY. 

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:52.943 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
&gt;&gt; BEFORE I START MY REMARKS, I 

00:41:52.943 --> 00:41:53.978 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
WANT TO SAY IT IS VERY 

00:41:53.978 --> 00:41:54.979 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
DIFFICULT FOR THOSE IN THE 

00:41:54.979 --> 00:41:55.980 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
AUDIENCE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU 

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.580 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
ARE SAYING. 

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.648 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
IF YOU TURN AWAY FROM YOUR 

00:41:57.648 --> 00:41:58.649 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
MICROPHONE, WE CAN'T HEAR YOU. 

00:41:58.649 --> 00:41:59.650 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
SO WE'RE STRUGGLING TO HEAR 

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:04.355 align:start size:50% position:20%,middle line:74%
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. 

00:42:04.355 --> 00:42:05.756 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
MANY OF THE POINTS I WAS GOING 

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:07.591 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
TO MAKE OF ALREADY BEEN MADE BY 

00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:13.497 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
CAROL AND DON AND SO ON. 

00:42:13.497 --> 00:42:14.698 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
BUT I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT WE 

00:42:14.698 --> 00:42:15.900 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
HAVE NOT REALLY HAD EASY ACCESS 

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.101 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
TO THE 2020 PROPOSED BUDGET. 

00:42:17.101 --> 00:42:17.968 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
I'M ALSO CONCERNED THAT YOU 

00:42:17.968 --> 00:42:19.169 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
HAVE ONLY MET, YOU ARE ONLY 

00:42:19.169 --> 00:42:23.407 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
MEETING TWICE A YEAR AS A BOARD 

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:24.275 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
OF COMMISSIONERS TO OVERSEE 

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:25.476 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
PARKS WORK. 

00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:32.116 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
I THINK THAT IS -- THE OTHER 

00:42:32.116 --> 00:42:36.620 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THING, BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A 

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.088 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
COPY, AND I WAS ABLE TO STUDY 

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:39.490 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THE BUDGET, IS THAT I AM VERY 

00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:43.327 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
CONCERNED ABOUT TWO THINGS. 

00:42:43.327 --> 00:42:44.328 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THE LACK OF APPARENT INTEREST 

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:44.995 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
IN REALLY HAVING NEIGHBORHOOD 

00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:45.296 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
PARKS. 

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:51.368 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
MY DAUGHTER LIVES IN MONTRCAL 

00:42:51.368 --> 00:42:54.738 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
AND IT IS A DANCE -- DENSE 

00:42:54.738 --> 00:42:55.539 align:start size:50% position:20%,middle line:74%
CITY, AND THEY HAVE 

00:42:55.539 --> 00:42:56.340 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS FILLED WITH 

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:56.941 align:start size:48% position:19%,middle line:74%
PEOPLE USING THEM. 

00:42:56.941 --> 00:42:58.342 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
EVERY FOUR OR FIVE BLOCKS. 

00:42:58.342 --> 00:42:58.742 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
IT'S AMAZING. 

00:42:58.742 --> 00:43:00.811 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
WE NEED MORE OF THAT HERE. 

00:43:00.811 --> 00:43:11.155 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THE OTHER THING IS, IT SEEMS TO 

00:43:11.155 --> 00:43:12.756 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
TAKE SO LONG TO DO THINGS, AND 

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:13.424 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
WE ARE ALWAYS CONSTANTLY 

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:14.024 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
STUDYING AND SOMEONE. 

00:43:14.024 --> 00:43:15.225 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
LET'S BE MORE REALISTIC ABOUT 

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:20.064 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
WHAT IS BEING DONE AND MAYBE 

00:43:20.064 --> 00:43:21.332 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
PERHAPS THE COUNCIL OR THE NEW 

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:22.132 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
COUNCIL SHOULD LOOK AT MORE 

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:22.967 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
PERFORMANCE OF THE AUDITS. 

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:23.367 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
THANK YOU. 

00:43:23.367 --> 00:43:28.872 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%

00:43:29.473 --> 00:43:30.874 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%

YOU'RE SPEAKING TO. 

00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:37.381 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; DAVID HINES ABOUT THE PARK. 

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:38.382 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
I FINALLY FIND IT HIGHLY 

00:43:38.382 --> 00:43:39.183 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
SUSPECT THAT MOTHER NATURE SEE 

00:43:39.183 --> 00:43:40.451 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
NEED SO MUCH MONEY TO PRESERVE 

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:41.585 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
PARKS AND CREATE PARKS WITHOUT

CONCRETE. 

00:43:41.885 --> 00:43:45.289 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
OR FOR LIKE EMPLOYEES TO MOVE 

00:43:45.289 --> 00:43:46.690 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
INTO A BUILDING WHILE PARKS AND

00:43:58.102 --> 00:43:59.503 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%

STREET OWED TRASH AND PORTA 

00:44:13.684 --> 00:44:14.718 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
POTTY SERVICE. 

00:44:14.718 --> 00:44:15.586 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED 

00:44:15.586 --> 00:44:16.587 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
BECAUSE WE NEED THE SAME

BATHROOM, SHOWER, LAUNDRY AS 

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:18.389 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%

THING FOR THEM. 

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:46.016 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
AND WE DON'T HAVE THAT FOR THE 

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:46.850 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
HOMELESS, BUT YOU'RE USING THE 

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:48.052 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
PARKS AND REC BUDGET TO CONDUCT 

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:49.653 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
A WAR ON THE HOMELESS WILL NOT 

00:44:49.653 --> 00:44:50.454 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
EVEN HAVING THE PROPER, LIKE 

00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:51.522 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
SCOTT MOREAU, WITH THE COPS 

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:53.123 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THING I HAVE A VAN TAKING YOU 

00:44:53.123 --> 00:44:54.158 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
TO THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT NOW 

00:44:54.158 --> 00:44:59.029 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
. HE IS NOWHERE TO EVER BE 

00:44:59.029 --> 00:44:59.363 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
FOUND. 

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:00.464 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
HE SENDS IN HIS LITTLE MINIONS 

00:45:00.464 --> 00:45:01.065 align:start size:25% position:13%,middle line:74%
THAT PAY. 

00:45:01.065 --> 00:45:02.266 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
BUT YOU CANNOT USE THE PARKS 

00:45:02.266 --> 00:45:03.667 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
AND REC, WHICH IS LIKE THE MOST 

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:04.334 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
EXPENSIVE, TO FINANCE MARTIN 

00:45:04.334 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
SELIG AND ALL THE SHADY 

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:20.551 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
BUILDINGS AND ALL THIS PEOPLE 

00:45:22.152 --> 00:45:22.986 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
DON'T GET THEIR HANDS DIRTY 

00:45:22.986 --> 00:45:23.987 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
BUTTER REALLY DIRTY IN THE 

00:45:23.987 --> 00:45:24.988 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
GOVERNMENT WHO ARE RUNNING THE 

00:45:24.988 --> 00:45:26.256 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
PARKS AND REC WERE ALLOWING IT 

00:45:26.256 --> 00:45:27.658 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
TO BE USED TO CONDUCT A WAR. 

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:29.093 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
AND I DARESAY IT IS MOSTLY THE 

00:45:29.093 --> 00:45:30.094 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
GATE PEOPLE IN THE GOVERNMENT 

00:45:30.094 --> 00:45:31.095 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
CONDUCTING A WAR ON INNOCENT 

00:45:31.095 --> 00:45:32.496 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
POOR PEOPLE AND HAVING A GOOD 

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:33.397 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
OLD TIME WITH JUDGING PEOPLE 

00:45:33.397 --> 00:45:33.664 align:start size:23% position:13%,middle line:74%
HARSHLY. 

00:45:33.664 --> 00:45:34.765 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
ACTED LIKE THEY COULD FINALLY 

00:45:34.765 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
FIND SOMEBODY THEY CAN KICK 

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:35.999 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
THEM. 

00:45:35.999 --> 00:45:37.201 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
AND THE COPS ARE ALLOWING A 

00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:37.835 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
WHOLE BUNCH OF PREDATORY 

00:45:37.835 --> 00:45:38.802 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
LOWLIFE SATURATING DRUG PUSHERS 

00:45:38.802 --> 00:45:39.470 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
WERE DESTROYING PEOPLES LIVES. 

00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:40.871 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
AND YOU ARE USING THESE PEOPLE 

00:45:40.871 --> 00:45:41.672 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
AS WRAPAROUND WERE PROFITABLE 

00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:42.406 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
SERVICES WHILE INNOCENT ARE 

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:43.107 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
STILL BEING FORSAKEN BECAUSE 

00:45:43.107 --> 00:45:44.508 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
YOU GUYS HAVE NUMBER TO GO 

00:45:44.508 --> 00:45:44.942 align:start size:43% position:17%,middle line:74%
EXCEPT THE JAIL. 

00:45:44.942 --> 00:45:46.176 align:start size:35% position:15%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; THANK YOU. 

00:45:46.176 --> 00:45:46.376 align:start size:15% position:12%,middle line:74%
OKAY. 

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:47.778 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
TRYING TO SEE IF WE CAN SPEAK 

00:45:47.778 --> 00:45:48.378 align:start size:40% position:17%,middle line:74%
TO HER FRIENDS. 

00:45:48.378 --> 00:45:49.413 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
I THINK PEOPLE ARE GETTING 

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:50.814 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
CONFUSED THE PARKS WAS DOING A 

00:45:50.814 --> 00:45:51.482 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
PRESENTATION WHICH IS SEPARATE 

00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:52.216 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
THAN THE METROPOLITAN PARK 

00:45:52.216 --> 00:45:53.484 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
DISTRICT AND WHAT WE ARE GOING 

00:45:53.484 --> 00:45:54.685 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
TO VOTE ON NEXT WEEK. 

00:45:54.685 --> 00:45:56.120 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
AND WHEN WE ARE REQUIRED TO BE, 

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:56.920 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
WHICH IS TWICE A YEAR. 

00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:59.723 align:start size:43% position:17%,middle line:74%
IS THAT CORRECT? 

00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:01.425 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THAT IS WHAT IS REQUIRED OF US. 

00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:02.426 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
BUT WE CAN GET OFF-LINE AND 

00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:07.798 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
EXPLAIN THAT PROCESS. 

00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:11.935 align:start size:50% position:20%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; COUPLE COMMENTS. 

00:46:11.935 --> 00:46:12.936 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
FOR CIVIL, JUST A PEOPLE 

00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:14.204 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
UNDERSTAND, WE ARE GOING TO BE 

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:15.606 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
COLLECTING MORE IN TERMS OF THE 

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:16.607 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
REVENUE FOR THE PARK DISTRICT 

00:46:16.607 --> 00:46:16.907 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
NEXT YEAR. 

00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:18.041 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
$53 MILLION VERSUS ABOUT 52 

00:46:18.041 --> 00:46:18.342 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
THIS YEAR. 

00:46:18.342 --> 00:46:19.243 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THE ESTIMATED ASSESSED VALUE IS 

00:46:19.243 --> 00:46:21.111 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE $.21 PER 

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:22.112 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THOUSAND DOLLARS, WHICH IS ONE 

00:46:22.112 --> 00:46:23.113 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
CENT LESS THAN WHAT WE 

00:46:23.113 --> 00:46:23.747 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
COLLECTED LAST YEAR. 

00:46:23.747 --> 00:46:33.924 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
LAST YEAR, $.22. THAT IS 

00:46:33.924 --> 00:46:35.325 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
BECAUSE THE AV HAS GONE UP AND 

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:36.326 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
WE'RE ABLE TO REDUCE THAT. 

00:46:36.326 --> 00:46:37.561 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
IN CASE PEOPLE THINK I'M GOING 

00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:39.163 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
TO SEE THIS BIG INCREASE IN MY 

00:46:39.163 --> 00:46:40.130 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
TAXES FOR THIS PARTICULAR PIECE 

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:41.165 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
OF THE LEVY, PARKS LEVY, THAT 

00:46:41.165 --> 00:46:46.670 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE. 

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:50.140 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; ROUGHLY 51 TO 53 MILLION, 

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.776 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
THE INCREASE SHIFT, DOES NOT 

00:46:52.776 --> 00:47:02.386 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
INCLUDE NEW CONSTRUCTION? 

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:12.796 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; I THINK PART OF THAT 

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:14.898 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
CHALLENGE TOO IS THAT WHEN THE 

00:47:14.898 --> 00:47:15.732 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
FIRST SIX-YEAR PARK DISTRICT 

00:47:15.732 --> 00:47:16.967 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
BUDGET WAS ADOPTED, IT WAS SET 

00:47:16.967 --> 00:47:18.168 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
AT A DOLLAR AMOUNT PER YEAR 

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:19.002 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
WITH AN INFLATIONARY CAUSE. 

00:47:19.002 --> 00:47:20.204 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THAT WAS ALL THE PROJECTS AND 

00:47:20.204 --> 00:47:20.604 align:start size:18% position:12%,middle line:74%
THEIR. 

00:47:20.604 --> 00:47:21.205 align:start size:50% position:20%,middle line:74%
IT DOES INCLUDE NEW 

00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:22.206 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
CONSTRUCTION, BUT THAT IS BEEN 

00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:23.407 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
SET SINCE IT WOULD IS ADOPTED 

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:24.274 align:start size:43% position:17%,middle line:74%
IN 2014 OR 2050. 

00:47:24.274 --> 00:47:25.475 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
THE REASON THE CHANGES IS 

00:47:25.475 --> 00:47:26.109 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
BECAUSE, ALTHOUGH THAT NUMBER 

00:47:26.109 --> 00:47:27.110 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
STAYS, THE BUDGET NUMBER STAYS 

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:28.111 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
THE SAME, AS THE PROPERTY 

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:30.781 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
VALUES GO UP, THE RATE CHANGES. 

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:31.782 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THE RATE WILL CHANGE, BUT OUR 

00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:32.983 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
BUDGET THAT IS BEEN APPROVED 

00:47:32.983 --> 00:47:34.218 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
ISN'T CHANGING . IT IS THE SAME 

00:47:34.218 --> 00:47:35.419 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
AMOUNT OF MONEY WE SAID WE 

00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
WOULD GET SIX YEARS AGO. 

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.688 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; THERE ARE CLEARLY A NUMBER 

00:47:37.688 --> 00:47:38.889 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
OF WAYS FOLKS COULD CHOOSE TO 

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:40.123 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
MEASURE WHAT WE ARE DOING WHEN 

00:47:40.123 --> 00:47:50.667 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
YOU ARE OVER THE NEXT. I THINK 

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:54.538 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
PROBABLY THE MOST REAL WAY 

00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:55.939 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
WOULD BE FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO 

00:47:55.939 --> 00:47:57.140 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
LOOK AT THEIR BILL AND SEE WHAT 

00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:58.408 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
THEY PAID THIS YEAR AND WHAT 

00:47:58.408 --> 00:47:59.610 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
THEY ARE PAYING NEXT YEAR. 

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:00.611 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
AND THAT WILL FLUCTUATE BY A 

00:48:00.611 --> 00:48:01.245 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
NUMBER THINGS. 

00:48:01.245 --> 00:48:02.045 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
WHAT IS YOUR ASSESSED VALUE 

00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:02.846 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
CHANGES RELATIVE TO EVERYONE 

00:48:02.846 --> 00:48:03.647 align:start size:50% position:20%,middle line:74%
ELSE'S IN THE CITY. 

00:48:03.647 --> 00:48:09.152 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
OUR RATE IS ACTUALLY GOING DOWN 

00:48:09.152 --> 00:48:09.953 align:start size:48% position:19%,middle line:74%
FROM $.22 TO $.21. 

00:48:09.953 --> 00:48:10.954 align:start size:60% position:25%,middle line:74%
THE TOTAL AMOUNT WE ARE 

00:48:10.954 --> 00:48:11.755 align:start size:58% position:24%,middle line:74%
COLLECTING IS GOING UP 

00:48:11.755 --> 00:48:12.623 align:start size:55% position:22%,middle line:74%
SLIGHTLY, A COUPLE OF 

00:48:12.623 --> 00:48:13.223 align:start size:48% position:19%,middle line:74%
PERCENTAGE POINTS. 

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:14.024 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
THAT ALSO REFLECTS THE FACT 

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:24.368 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THERE IS A LOT MORE VALUED IN 

00:48:24.368 --> 00:48:25.369 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
THE CITY TO COLLECT FROM. 

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:26.236 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
DOESN'T NECESSARILY IMPLY AN 

00:48:26.236 --> 00:48:26.837 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
INDIVIDUAL WILL PAY. 

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:28.038 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
BUT IF YOU'VE DONE A MAJOR 

00:48:28.038 --> 00:48:29.072 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
REMODEL THAT IS BEEN CAPTURED, 

00:48:29.072 --> 00:48:30.274 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
IT WOULD IMPROVE IT IF YOUR 

00:48:30.274 --> 00:48:31.475 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
PROPERTY VALUE IS GOING UP A 

00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:32.476 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
LOT HIGHER THAN YOUR NEIGHBORS 

00:48:32.476 --> 00:48:33.777 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
BECAUSE MAYBE IT IS OWNED A 

00:48:33.777 --> 00:48:34.144 align:start size:33% position:15%,middle line:74%
CERTAIN WAY. 

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:35.379 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
BUT PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE 

00:48:35.379 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
WILL SEE A LOWER PAYMENT NEXT 

00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:37.047 align:start size:25% position:13%,middle line:74%
YEAR TOO. 

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:38.181 align:start size:53% position:21%,middle line:74%
OF THAT WILL VARY BY 

00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:38.548 align:start size:33% position:15%,middle line:74%
INDIVIDUALS. 

00:48:38.548 --> 00:48:39.583 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
&gt;&gt; I SHOULD ADD BECAUSE THAT IS 

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:41.051 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
WHAT WE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT 

00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:42.386 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
AND HAVE ROBUST ACTIVITY ABOUT 

00:48:42.386 --> 00:48:49.993 align:start size:48% position:19%,middle line:74%
THE SIX-YEAR PLAN. 

00:48:49.993 --> 00:48:50.994 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
WE HAVE THIS NEXT YEAR TO 

00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:52.195 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
FINISH OUT, AND THEN WE PUT 

00:48:52.195 --> 00:48:53.397 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
TOGETHER A PLAN FOR THE NEXT 

00:48:53.397 --> 00:48:54.665 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
SIX YEARS, BUT WE'RE TRYING TO 

00:48:54.665 --> 00:48:56.066 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
DO IS BE TRUE TO WHAT THE 

00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:57.501 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
VOTERS ASK FOR IN 2014 ABOUT, 

00:48:57.501 --> 00:49:02.806 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
WE ALL VOTED FOR PARKS, CREATED 

00:49:02.806 --> 00:49:03.807 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
A METROPOLITAN PARK DISTRICT. 

00:49:03.807 --> 00:49:04.808 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
THAT IS WHERE THE CONFUSION IS. 

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:05.809 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
PEOPLE CONFUSE THAT WITH THE 

00:49:05.809 --> 00:49:06.610 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
ACTUAL PARKS COMMITTEE, WHICH 

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:07.210 align:start size:33% position:15%,middle line:74%
IS SEPARATE. 

00:49:07.210 --> 00:49:08.078 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
THOUGH INTEGRATED AND WE TALK 

00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:08.679 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
TO EACH OTHER. 

00:49:08.679 --> 00:49:10.714 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
SO IT ISN'T THAT IT HASN'T 

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:14.985 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
GOTTEN A NOTICE, WHEN DO WE 

00:49:14.985 --> 00:49:15.786 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
ANTICIPATE OUR SIX-YEAR PLAN 

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:20.824 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
COMING OUT? 

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:21.625 align:start size:45% position:18%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; 21 AND BEYOND. 

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:22.893 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
THAT IS THE WORK OF NEXT YEAR. 

00:49:22.893 --> 00:49:28.031 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
IT WILL BE PART OF THE NEXT 

00:49:28.031 --> 00:49:28.999 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
YEAR BUDGET THAT WILL INCLUDE 

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:29.800 align:start size:73% position:36%,middle line:74%
THE SIX-YEAR FINANCIAL PLAN. 

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.201 align:start size:68% position:31%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; AND WE WILL BE HAVING A 

00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:36.773 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE SIX-YEAR 

00:49:36.773 --> 00:49:40.143 align:start size:80% position:0% line:74%
PLAN AND COMMITTEE WHERE PEOPLE 

00:49:40.143 --> 00:49:41.144 align:start size:63% position:27%,middle line:74%
CAN COME AND GIVE PUBLIC 

00:49:41.144 --> 00:49:41.545 align:start size:23% position:13%,middle line:74%
COMMENT. 

00:49:41.545 --> 00:49:42.546 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
IT WILL BE POSTED JUST LIKE 

00:49:42.546 --> 00:49:43.814 align:start size:75% position:40%,middle line:74%
WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR THE LAST 

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:44.414 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
FOUR YEARS. 

00:49:44.414 --> 00:49:45.649 align:start size:78% position:44%,middle line:74%
I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO BE CLEAR 

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:46.049 align:start size:30% position:14%,middle line:74%
ABOUT THAT. 

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:46.450 align:start size:38% position:16%,middle line:74%
ANYTHING ELSE? 

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:47.451 align:start size:70% position:33%,middle line:74%
&gt;&gt; SO THE METROPOLITAN PARK 

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:48.251 align:start size:65% position:29%,middle line:74%
DISTRICT BOARD WILL STAND 

00:49:48.251 --> 00:49:51.655 align:start size:28% position:14%,middle line:74%
ADJOURNED.
