", " FOR EXAMPLE, IN INITIATIVE 1.6, ", " UTILITY BUILDINGS, WE RECEIVE  THOSE PILLS TWICE A YEAR. ", " SO IT IS NOT A STRAIGHTFORWARD  SPEND. ", " AND WE FULLY EXPECT TO SPEND  MOST OF THE 2019 OPERATING  INITIATIVES BY THE END OF THIS  YEAR. ", " &gt;&gt; THE NEXT SLIDE SHOWS OUR  PARK DISTRICT FINANCIALS FOR  THE CAPITOL SIDE. ", " WE, SO AGAIN, THERE ARE TWO  PARTS TO THE TABLE. ", " ONE SHOWS THE 2015 TO 2018 THAT  &gt;&gt; GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS  SLIDE FOR A MOMENT. ", " THANK YOU. ", " ON THE RESTORING THE COMMUNITY  CENTER OPERATIONS. ", " I KNOW THERE WERE PLANS, AND WE  DIED IDENTIFIED SIX. ", " COMMUNITY CENTERS IN OUR 2015  INITIAL BUDGET.

", " &gt;&gt; SO ON THE CAPITOL SIDE, THIS  TABLE SHOWS BUDGET TO ACTUALS  2015 THROUGH 2018 AS WELL AS  BUDGET TO ACTUALS FOR 2019  THROUGH SEPTEMBER. ", " AND CUMULATIVE SPENDING FOR THE  PARK DISTRICT ON THE CAPITOL  SIDE IS APPROXIMATELY 50%, AND  THIS COMES FROM A TOTAL  ALLOCATION OF $142 MILLION,  WHICH IS COMPRISED OF THIS $140  MILLION IN THE 2015 THROUGH  2018 COLUMN AS WELL AS 28  MILLION THAT WAS INCLUDED IN  THE 2019 ADOPTED. I SHOULD NOTE ", " TOO THAT THE 2019 REVISED  BUDGET COLUMN YOU SEE HERE  INCLUDES BOTH CARRY FORWARD  FROM 2015 THROUGH 2018 AS WELL  AS THE 2019 ADOPTED BUDGET. ", " &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SLOWDOWN? ", " SO WHAT WAS THE TOTAL AMOUNT  LAST MONTH? ", " I LOST TWO. ", " &gt;&gt; OKAY. ", " WHAT I WANTED TO SAY HERE IS  THAT OUR TOTAL BUDGET  ALLOCATION THUS FAR HAS BEEN  ABOUT $142 MILLION, AND THAT IS  COMPRISED OF $140 MILLION THAT  WE HAD IN THE 2015 TO 2018  BUDGET. ", " AND THEN INCLUDED IN THE 2019  REVISED BUDGET WE HAVE 28  MILLION OF 2019. ", " SO THE 114 PLUS THE 28 MILLION  EQUALS 142 MILLION.

", " IF YOU TAKE 70 MILLION INTO THE  142, YOU GET ABOUT 50%. ", " &gt;&gt; OKAY. ", " &gt;&gt; SO TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW ITEMS  IN THE SLIDE. ", " THE FIRST ONE I THINK IS ONE OF  INTEREST, THE ONE POINT ONE  MAJOR MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND  ASSET MANAGEMENT. ", " AND SPENDING HAS BEEN  ACCELERATING ANNUAL LEASE ON  THIS SINCE 2016 WITH A PLAN  SPANNED THIS YEAR OF $22  MILLION, THE HIGHEST OF ALL THE  YEARS.

", " LARGE PROJECTS WITH ANTICIPATED  COMPLETION IN 2020 INCLUDE  ATHLETIC FIELD RENOVATIONS,  SYNTHETIC TURF, REPLACEMENTS,  POOL RENOVATIONS AND PLAY  RENOVATIONS. ", " ANOTHER INITIATIVE TO HIGHLIGHT  HERE IS ONE POINT TO, COMMUNITY  CENTER REHABILITATION AND  DEVELOPMENT. ", " THIS IS THE ONE I THINK. ", " THIS WAS INITIALLY ON HOLD  WHILE WE COMPLETED THE  COMMUNITY CENTER STRATEGIC  PLAN, WHICH WAS IN SEPTEMBER  2016. ", " STABILIZATION WORK IS UNDERWAY  FOR FIVEOF THE SIX CENTERS,  INCLUDING HIAWATHA, JEFFERSON,  MAGNOLIA, QUEEN AND AND SOUTH  PARK. ", " &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A COMMUNITY CENTER  ASSESSMENT PLAN?

", " INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY THAT  WE TALKED MANY TIMES ABOUT  BEING ABLE TO RESTORE THE  CENTER, BUT TO BUILD HOUSING ON  TOP OF SOME OF THEM. ", " &gt;&gt; THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. ", " SO THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION  IN TERMS OF THE BAND-AID  PRESSURE, YOU ARE EXACTLY  RIGHT, THAT WAS OUR CONCERN AS  WELL. ", " WE DID THE ORIGINAL PLAN, IT  WAS LOOKING AT HOW TO INVEST  ENOUGH SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO  OPERATE. ", " IT IS A LONGER-TERM QUESTION  PALMA BUT THAT WAS WHAT THE  STABILIZATION CONCEPT IS ABOUT. ", " IN TERMS OF LONGER-TERM  INVESTMENT, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE  IN THE MIDDLE OF RIGHT NOW. ", " THE STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS  WE JUST FINISHED THAT WE WILL  COME BACK AND SHARE, AND THEN  THAT STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS  WILL BE THE FOUNDATION FOR THE  CONVERSATION FOR THE NEXT 6 TO  12 YEARS OF THE PARK DISTRICT  CYCLE. ", " SO A BIG PART OF THAT WORK IS  LOOKING AT ALL THE COMMUNITY  CENTER PORTFOLIO TO GET A SENSE  OF WHERE WE WANT THESE  COMMUNITY CENTERS TO BE FROM A  MINIMUM OPERATIONAL STANDPOINT  AND WHAT, IF ANYTHING, SHOULD  BE EXPANDED. ", " BEYOND THE BAND-AID BUT THOSE  ARE STILL THINGS WE ARE  PLANNING IN THE FINANCIALS THAT  WE DON'T HAVE, BUT I KNOW YOU  KNOW SOME OF THESE BUILDINGS,  THAT NUMBER COULD GET VERY BIG  VERY QUICKLY.

", " AS WAS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED,  THE FIRST COMPLETED PROJECT,  ALICE PAUL, OPENED IN JUNE OF  THIS YEAR AND URBAN TRIANGLE  WAS COMPLETED. ", " THE LAST ONE WE WANT TO  HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU IS SMITH COVE  PARK DEVELOPMENT. ", " THIS ONE IS CURRENTLY IN EARLY  DESIGN STAGES, WHICH IS  REFLECTED IN THE SPENDING, THE  LOW SPENDING. ", " CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTATION IS  NEAR 100%, AND THE TEAM IS  WAITING FOR FINAL PERMITS. ", " THE PROJECT WILL BE BID IN THE  FALL OR WINTER, FALL OF 19 OR  WINTER 2020 AND CONSTRUCTION  WILL BEGIN IN EARLY 2020 IN THE  SECOND PHASE, THE EASTERN  PORTION, WILL BE CONSIDERED AS  PART OF THE NEXT CYCLE  FINANCIAL PLAN. ", " &gt;&gt; COUNCILMEMBER BACK SHOPPING  &gt;&gt; I KNOW DON HARPER LIKE ME  HAS BEEN WORKING ON SMITH COVE  PARK FOR WHAT IT FEELS LIKE  MUCH OF OUR LIFETIME NOW. ", " BUT IT FEELS TO ME THAT THE  WHOLE PROJECT IS WAY MORE  EXPENSIVE THAN WHAT WE HAD  INITIALLY THOUGHT. ", " SO THE WEST SIDE WE HAD THE  SOCCER FIELDS AND THEN WE HAD  TO DO THE CONSTRUCTION FOR THE  OVERFLOW, OR THE PIPES THAT  WERE COMING DOWN OFF THE  HILLSIDE. ", " AND THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING  ELSE THAT WENT ON, AND THEN WE  WERE DIGGING IT UP AGAIN. ", " DO WE HAVE A SCHEDULE NOW FOR  WHEN THAT WESTSIDE WILL BE  COMPLETED? ", " AND ALSO, I KNOW THE  NEIGHBORHOOD HAS REALLY BEEN  INTERESTED IN THE EASTSIDE  BECAUSE THAT TOUCHES WATER ON  THE EASTSIDE, BUT ALSO  POTENTIALLY RIGHT DOWN TO THE  WATER ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE  PARK.

", " I DON'T HAVE A NOTE ON HOW LONG  THE CONSTRUCTION IS ANTICIPATED  TO TAKE, BUT WE SHOULD START  CONSTRUCTION. ", " THE SECOND PHASE, AS YOU SAID,  IS PROBABLY JUST AS EXPENSIVE  AS THE FIRST PHASE, BUT THAT IS  NOT BEEN COSTED OUT YET AND THE  ANTICIPATION IS TO LOOK AT IT  FOR THE SECOND ROUND. ", " &gt;&gt; WE HAVE HAD MANY DESIGNS AND  PEOPLE IN MAGNOLIA AND QUEEN  ANNE IN PARTICULAR HAVE BEEN  LOOKING AT MAKING THAT A PLACE  WHERE PEOPLE CAN LAUNCH THEIR  KAYAKS AND ALSO DO, I THINK  THERE WAS EVEN SOME VOLLEYBALL  COURTS THAT WERE GOING TO BE  INCLUDED. ", " BUT PRIMARILY IT WAS NOT GOING  TO BE IS ACTIVELY SCHEDULED AS  WHAT WAS HAPPENING ON THE WEST  SIDE.

", " IS DEFINITELY THERE. ", " &gt;&gt; SOMEWHERE. ", " &gt;&gt; JUST ON THE 2019 BUDGET  VERSUS ACTUALS, DID THE  TIMELINE SLIP FROM WHEN WE SET  THE BUDGET LAST YEAR  SIGNIFICANTLY?

", " &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. ", " &gt;&gt; I THINK THE DESIGN AND THE  BIDDING AND ALL OF THAT TOOK A  LITTLE LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED. ", " THOSE COSTS ONLY REFLECT THE  EARLY DESIGN. ", " I'M SURE THEY'RE STILL BILLS  DUE TO US FOR SOME OF THE FINAL  DESIGN BEFORE WE GO TO BED. ", " &gt;&gt; WHEN I LOOK ACROSS THE  BOARD, ACTUALS THROUGH  SEPTEMBER VERSUS BUDGET. ", " WE'RE AT 22%, SO IS THAT THEME  JUST CONSISTENT ACROSS THEM? ", " &gt;&gt; THERE ARE DIFFERENT REASONS  FOR EACH OF THESE THINGS, BUT  HOLISTICALLY, IT IS BROUGHT  THEMED THAT I AM REALLY  CONCERNED ABOUT LOOKING AT IT  FROM THE STANDPOINT OF JUST  BEING ABLE TO GET THE  INFORMATION. ", " FOR EXAMPLE, THIS TABLE IS  CONFUSING IN MANY WAYS. ", " NOT BECAUSE, ONLY BECAUSE IT IS  HARD TO PUT A LOT OF  INFORMATION. ", " FOR EXAMPLE, FOR 2019 THE $93  MILLION IN THE THIRD TO LAST  COLUMN INCLUDES CARRYOVER FUNDS  FROM 2015 THROUGH 2018 PLUS $28  MILLION NEW FOR 2019. ", " THOSE CARRYOVERS ARE HARDER  BECAUSE THERE ARE PROJECTS IN  VARIOUS STAGES. ", " SUMMER STILL STARTING EARLY,  SOME ALMOST DONE. ", " IT IS HARD TO TRACK THEM UNLESS  WE PUT TOGETHER A GIGANTIC  SPREADSHEET FOR YOU. ", " PLUS THE --  &gt;&gt; 70. ", " &gt;&gt; THE TOTAL WE SPENT IS ABOUT  50% OF EVERYTHING WE HAVE HAD  ALLOCATED. ", " AGAIN, EVERY PROJECT IS  DIFFERENT, SOME ARE COMPLETELY  DONE IN SUMMER DELAYED FOR  DIFFERENT REASONS. ", " THAT IS A NUMBER I AM WATCHING  VERY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE WE  CONTINUE TO STAY ON TOP OF IT  AND DO BETTER WITH REPORTING,  BUT ALSO DO BETTER WITH OUR  PROJECT MANAGEMENT. ", " SO A COUPLE OF THINGS WE HAVE  DONE ALREADY IS WE HAVE MADE  SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WITH OUR  PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT  DIVISION THAT OVERSEES ALL  THESE PROJECTS TO JUST DO A  BETTER JOB OF THAT. ", " WE ARE ADDING A NEW PROCESS FOR  EXAMPLE, A STAGE GATING PROCESS  THAT EACH STAGE WE HAVE BETTER  INFORMATION BECAUSE OFTEN WHAT  WILL HAPPEN, BUT THE PROJECT  WILL GO THROUGH, AND WHEN IT IS  ABOUT TO GO TO BED, WE REALIZE  THE ESTIMATES ARE HIGHER THAN  THE BUDGET SO THEN THE KIDS PUT  ON HOLD AND THEN WE HAVE TO  FIGURE OUT HOW TO FUND IT. ", " WE WANT TO SET IT UP SO THAT  EACH STAGE WE HAVE THOSE  CONVERSATIONS EARLY AND HAVE A  BETTER SENSE OF WHAT IS  HAPPENING. ", " AND FRANKLY WE JUST ADDED MORE  CAPACITY. ", " THIS IS A GROUP THAT HAS BEEN  DELIVERING ROUGHLY $70 MILLION  WORTH OF PROJECTS EVERY YEAR. ", " AT LEAST ACTIVE PROJECTS. ", " THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS WE  HAVE ADDED MORE STAFF THERE. ", " FINALLY, WE ARE GETTING AN  OUTSIDE CONSULTANT, PAR  CONSULTING, COMING IN AND  DIGGING INTO ALL OF THESE AND  GIVING RECOMMENDATIONS, SOME OF  WHICH WERE ALREADY STARTING TO  IMPLEMENT. ", " BUT OUR HOPE IS THAT AS WE  CLOSE OUT THIS FIRST SIX YEAR  CYCLE, WE ARE DOING BETTER NOW  WAS SPENDING, BUT REALLY HAVE A  SOLID PLAN TO MAKE SURE WE ARE  BETTER AT MANAGING. ", " AND PRESENTING THE INFORMATION  IN A WAY THAT IS EASIER TO  FOLLOW FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND. ", " &gt;&gt; I WILL JUST SAY THAT IT  SEEMS LIKE A SIMILAR PARALLEL  TO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES  D.O.T. ", " HAS HAD. ITSELF LIKE SOME OF ", " THE RESPONSES YOU'RE MAKING ARE  SIMILAR TO THAT, WHICH IS  GREAT. ", " OBVIOUSLY, AS WE MOVE TOWARDS  THIS TIME NEXT YEAR WHEN WE  WILL BE UPDATING, I THINK IT IS  GOING TO BE REALLY HELPFUL TO  HAVE AS MUCH CLARITY ABOUT  WHERE WE ARE GOING ON THAT. ", " YOU KNOW, WHEN A PROJECT TAKES  FOUR YEARS INSTEAD OF TWO  YEARS, THERE IS PROBABLY AT A  COST, BUT THE BIGGEST THING FOR  MY PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THE  PROJECT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO BE  USED FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS. ", " IF THE REALITY IS THAT WE ARE  JUST TOO AMBITIOUS IN THE  TIMELINES AND THE PROJECTS ARE  FOR YOUR PROJECTS, AND WE JUST  MISSED THAT WHEN WE FIRST PUT  IT IN, THEN THAT IS FAIR. ", " LET'S USE THAT WHEN WE THINK  ABOUT HOW MUCH CAPACITY WE HAVE  NEXT YEAR WITH THE CASH FLOWS  COMING IN, AND LET'S MATCH THE  STAFF TO THAT AS SOON AS WE CAN  TOO. ", " &gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY. ", " BECAUSE NOT EVERY PROJECT TAKES  THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME. ", " WE NEED TO BE MUCH MORE  SPECIFIC ABOUT THESE INDIVIDUAL  POJECTS. ", " WHICH WILL HAVE INPUT IN THE  WAY WE BUDGET. ", " BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THE WAY WE  BUDGET, WE BUDGET FOR EVERY  PROJECT HAVING THESE THREE  PHASES IS A PHASE 1 IS THIS  YOUR, PHASE 2 IS THIS YEAR, BUT  IF ANYTHING CHANGES BECAUSE THE  SCOPE IS DIFFERENT, THEN THE  BUDGETING IS OUT OF WHACK.

", " HAS STRUGGLED WITH HOW TO  ACCURATELY REPORT THE CARRYOVER  MONEY FROM LAST YEAR TO THIS  YEAR. ", " ARE WE ON TARGET OR NOT? ", " DEPENDS ON HOW YOU LOOK AT THE  NUMBER. ", " SO NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING  TO WORK ON, BUT SOME WAY TO  REPORT ON THAT SO WE CAN HAVE  WAYS TO ESSENTIALLY HOLD YOU  ALL ACCOUNTABLE TO SAY I KNOW  WE STARTED OFF SLOW, BUT ARE WE  ON PACE NOW? ", " SOME WAY TO DELIVER THAT  INFORMATION WOULD BE HELPFUL. ", " &gt;&gt; NOT KEEPING THIS TO DEATH,  THE OTHER COMPETITION IN  ADDITION TO TIMING IS THE  DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES. ", " THAT IS WHERE THE TRANSPARENCY  PIECE GETS REALLY IMPORTANT AND  COMPLICATED. ", " I DO YOU THINK IT IS REALLY  IMPORTANT.
